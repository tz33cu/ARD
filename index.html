<p>Here we use "relational data" to refer to numerical values that describe the relations among a collection of entities. Following the convention of social network analysis, we refer to these entities as "<em>egos</em>". The relations can be dichotomous, i.e., coded by 0 or 1 for indications of the absence and existence of a relation, transaction, interaction or action. Discrete-valued or continuous-valued relations can also be defined. The most common type of relational data is a network, described by a list of egos and an adjacency matrix among the egos. </p>

<p>Aggregated relational data are usually collected at a (randomly) sampled ego, where all the relations connected to this ego are aggregated into a single or a few <em>summary</em> statistics. The main motivation of collecting ARD, in lieu of the full set of relational data, is the reduced collection and storage cost of ARD. For our research on social networks, we have analyzed ARD collected using standard survey questions in the form of "how many ... do you know?" Such questions invite the respondents (sampled egos from the social network) to report aggregated counts of their social ties (relations) towards certain subgroups of the population. </p>
